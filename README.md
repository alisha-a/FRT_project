project title--
Web App Deployment on Azure.

Problem Statement/Opportunity*--
Digital presence is a must for any organisation. Similarly many health and yoga center exists but they do not have a physical presence. A web app is deployed on Azure to expand the reach of one such yoga center.

problem description--
Digital presence is very important for any one in today's world. Due to lack of resources and high cost to host a wesite, many good stores can't afford to go online and mark their presence. We have built and deployed a website on Azure to expand the reach of one such health center called by name "Hitty and Kitty". The web app is deployed on cloud. The yoga center can now reach to mass audience and expand their reach.
